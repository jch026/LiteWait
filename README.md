Dining out is a great social experience for people of all walks but eating out can be a hassle, and
people spend a lot of time waiting for getting a place in a restaurant. Friends, colleagues, business
partners and families usually go through this hassle regularly.

LightWait’s mission is to make it easier to connect people with great local businesses. We want
you to be able to spend less time waiting and more time experiencing what your city has to offer.
LightWait is targeted towards people who dine out by gathering restaurant wait time information
from crowdsourced user submissions.

In the current sphere, there are certain apps where their restaurant wait times are not adjusted in
“real time”, but rather estimated based on the averages of previous data. Furthermore, there are other
apps that rely on each restaurant to voluntarily participate in giving updated wait times to users,
which limits the amount of restaurants available to the public. While these apps are fundamentally
different and have many limitations, LightWait solves the problem by following proven business
models.

To incentivize user data submissions, LightWait utilizes a points-based reward system - users
earn points for completing various actions (e.g. reporting a wait time), and can convert these points
into raffle tickets for daily drawings of restaurant and visa gift cards. In addition, restaurants will
have the capability to directly update their wait times if they decide to be a part of our mission.
LightWait is particularly valuable to customers because not only does it save time and money, but it
also has the potential to bring new experiences to people.
